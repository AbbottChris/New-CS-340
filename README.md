# New-CS-340
I write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable by utilizing my resources and compiling the correct code. The benefit of working this way is you can go step by step and see what mistakes you have made in your code. 

I approach a problem as a computer science by working out the problem from all angles trying to find the best possible solution. I was working with the database and dashboard projects going over the requirements until they met the needs of the client. 

Computer Scientists are always pushing the envelope and thinking outside the box. They develop new pieces of programming that some peope would never think of.
